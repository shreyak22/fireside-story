    <p>It was a dark and stormy night, the ship was swaying fiercely in the strong winds.</p>
    <p>In the early 1700s, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica aboard HMS Dauntless, 
        Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth, and Lieutenant James Norrington encounter a shipwreck and
         recover a boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck,
          and keeps it in order to protect him...</p>
    <p> But this story isn't about her.  This story is about the greatest pirate the world has ever seen!</p>

  <p>Let's talk about the pirate. Jack, the original captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa staged a mutiny,
       gets assistance from Will to reclaim his ship. The two commandeer HMS Interceptor, 
       a small and very fast sloop-of-war, and head for Tortuga to recruit a crew. 
      At Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and the final gold piece.   </p>
